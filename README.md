# Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM)

The Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) has been developed since 2007 and has been an important tool for Norwegian climate researchers in the study of the past, present and future climate. NorESM has also contributed to climate simulation that has been used in research assessed in the IPCC’s fifth main report.

Visit the [NorESM home page](https://www.noresm.org/) to learn more about the NorESM model system, model data products and related projects.


# NorESM documentation

# Branches in NorESM

This repository has the following NorESM branches:

* **master** - combines and contains recent developments, based on the latest release (at this stage NorESM2.0.2)

* **noresm2_3_develop** - development branch for upcoming NorESM2.3 version

* **noresm2.2** - contain updates from CESM2.2.  Only few compsets work technically at the moment (e.g. coupled compsets do not work), and no results have been verified yet.  This branch should not be used for scientific studies.

* **release-noresm2.0.2_keyClim** - NorESM2 version for KeyClim project experiments (started from tag release-noresm2.0.2)

* **noresm_landsites** - NorESM2 version for site-level simulations over land, specifically working with [NorESM Land Sites Platform](https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresm-land-sites-platform)

* **noresm2_1_develop** - includes a few bug fixes along with numerous code improvements from the NorESM2.0 release (see [NorESM2.1 documentation](https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm2.1/) for further details).

* **noresm2** - contains NorESM2.0.X documentation, code and configurations as used for most NorESM2-LM and NorESM2-MM CMIP6 simulations. See documentation for a [detailed description of the NorESM2.0.X releases](https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm2/access/releases_noresm20.html).

* **noresm1** - contains a copy of old wiki NorESM1 documentation, refering to https://github.com/metno/noresm NorESM1 code, and incompletely to the development code under https://github.com/metno/noresm-dev (restricted access), used in 2019 for CMIP6 simulations
