Welcome to norESM documentation!
================================================

The purpose of the norESM documentation is to provide a common place for NorESM users and developers to share information. What tools are you using? Which
version should I run for what purpose? etc.

This documentation is being re-organized and a Github project has been created to follow the progress at https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM-docs/projects. 

If you have any questions or interested in actively participate in the reorganization, create a new issue on github at https://github.com/NorESMhub/norESM-docs/issues

Information on how to contribute can be found at https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM-docs/blob/master/README.md.
