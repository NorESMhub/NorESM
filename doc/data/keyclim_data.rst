Experiments without anthropogenic aerosols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

hist-piAerOxid
++++++++++++++++++++

As the CMIP6 historical experiment, but emissions of aerosols, emissions of aerosol pre-cursors, and oxidant concentrations (O3, OH, HO2, NO3) are kept at pre-industrial levels. 

**Raw model output** is available on NIRD under:

ssp370-piAerOxid
+++++++++++++++++++++

As the CMIP6 SSP3-7.0 experiment, but emissions of aerosols, emissions of aerosol pre-cursors, and oxidant concentrations (O3, OH, HO2, NO3) are kept at pre-industrial levels.
