Ocean and Sea-Ice
==================

BLOM
''''

In NorESM2, the ocean component BLOM/iHAMOCC can be either run fully coupled to the other model components, or in ocean carbon-cycle stand alone configuration. The latter setup follows the CMIP6-OMIP protocol (see below) and is driven by atmospheric input data derived from reanalysis products (called *data-atmosphere*, DATM).


OMIP-type experiments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP; Griffies et al., 2016) is an endorsed project in the CMIP6. OMIP provides a protocol for global ocean/sea-ice models forced by a common prescribed atmospheric forcing, and a protocol for ocean diagnostics to be saved as part of CMIP6. OMIP includes a physical component (Griffies et al., 2016) and a biogeochemistry component (Orr et al. 2017).

Prior to OMIP, the framework of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE) provides ocean and climate modellers with a common protocol for running coupled ocean/sea-ice models with boundary forcing derived from common atmospheric datasets. The CORE forcing dataset was described by Large and Yeager (2004, 2009), which is largely based on the surface-atmospheric fields derived from NCEP/NCAR atmospheric reanalysis . CORE has subsequently evolved into phase 1 of the physical part of OMIP (OMIP-1). The OMIP1/CORE-II experiment forces the ocean through use of the interannually varying atmospheric state of Large and Yeager (2009), along with river runoff data based on Dai et al. (2009).

The Large and Yeager (2009) forcing dataset covers the period from 1948 to 2009, and has not been updated since 2009. Thereafter, Tsujino et al. (2018) developed a surface atmospheric dataset based on the Japanese 55-year atmospheric reanalysis (JRA-55; Kobayashi et al., 2015), referred to as JRA55-do, which has been endorsed under the protocol for phase 2 of OMIP (OMIP-2). Currently, JRA55-do covers the period from 1958 to 2018 with planned continuous annual updates. Comparing to CORE-II, the JRA55-do forcing has an increased temporal frequency (from 6 hours to 3 hours), and a refined horizontal resolution (from 1.875¬∞ to 0.5625¬∞).

The readers are referred to Large and Yeager (2009) and Tsujino et al. (2018) for a detailed description of the CORE-II and JRA55-do forcing, respectively, including the bulk formulae used for computing turbulent fluxes for heat and momentum. An evaluation and comparison of the simulated ocean and sea ice mean states and variability from 11 state-of-the-art global ocean/sea-ice models (including NorESM-BLOM), based on OMIP-1/CORE-II and OMIP-2/JRA55-do, is presented by Tsujino et al. (2020).


BLOM OMIP specifics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- In the BLOM OMIP simulations, sea surface salinity is restored to monthly climatology with a piston velocity of 50 m per 300 days applied globally for both OMIP-1 and OMIP-2 simulations. The restoring salt flux is normalized so that the global area weighted sum of the restoring flux is zero. 

- A dimensionless parameter ùõº=1 is used in the estimation of the near-surface wind correction, e.g. **ùõ•ùëà** = **ùëà** \ :sub:`atm`\-ùõº **ùëà** :sub:`ocn`\, to account for the imprint of the ocean currents on the surface wind stress in an ocean/sea-ice model. The OMIP community has not reached a consensus on the way Œ± should be imposed; for a discussion of Œ± and its values among other OMIP models, refer to Tsujino et al. (2020).

- The OMIP-1 and OMIP-2 simulations of BLOM have completed 6 repeating forcing cycles of the forcing periods 1948-2009 and 1958-2018, respectively.

- The OMIP-1/CORE-II experiment is documented by Bentsen et al. (2020, *in prep.*), including a comparison to a previous CORE-II experiment simulated by the CMIP5 version of NorESM1. In addition, a number of common global ocean and sea ice metrics simulated by BLOM (including both OMIP-1 and OMIP-2 experiments) is included and evaluated in the multi-model synthesis paper of Tsujino et al. (2020).

OMIP compsets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- OMIP-1/CORE-II:   NOIIAOC20TR
- OMIP-2/JRA55-do:  NOIIAJRAOC20TR


Forcing datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


- **OMIP-1/CORE-II**
  
  Forcing dataset described in detail by Large and Yeager (2009). The forcing files are located in ::
  
  /DIN_LOC_ROOT/ocn/iaf/,
  
  where DIN_LOC_ROOT is the base input data directory, which depends on the machine (on fram it is /cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata/).


- **OMIP-2/JRA55-do**

  Forcing dataset described in detail by Tsujino et al. (2018). The forcing files are located at (on Fram) ::

  /DIN_LOC_ROOT/ocn/jra55/v1.3_noleap/



Modify user namelist for BLOM/iHAMOCC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Model parameters and adjusting model output can be done in user_nl_blom, which is present in the case directory after ./case.setup has been excecuted. The resolved namelist for BLOM/iHAMOCC is saved in CaseDocs/ocn_in, and specifies a number of physical parameters (such as vertical and horizontal mixing), as well as model output settings and frequencies. Output settings include options for daily (hd/hbgcd), monthly (hm/hbgcm), and yearly (hy/hbgcy) output, where the files containing 'bgc' in their filenames are iHAMOCC output files. Note that the resolved namelist (CaseDocs/ocn_in) should **never** be used to place user defined changes, since this file is re-created (overwritten) every time the model is submitted. User defined namelist changes need to be placed in user_nl_blom, for example
::

  BDMC2 = .15
  NIWGF = .5

Note that it does not matter which namelist group the variables belong (namelist groups must not be specified in user_nl_blom).  BLOM parameters that can be changed via namelist settings are documented in the resolved namelist file (see CaseDocs/ocn_in after running ./preview_namelists or building the case). In iHAMOCC, model parameters are currently hard-coded, i.e. they cannot be changed through namelist settings. To change iHAMOCC model parameters, please see below under 'Code modifications'.

For changing the output in BLOM or iHAMOCC, the example below shows how to change the monthly mean (default) to yearly mean layered ocean temperature. The default setting (as can be seen in CaseDocs/ocn_in after running ./preview_namelists or building the case) is
::

   &DIAPHY
     GLB_FNAMETAG = 'hd','hm','hy',
     GLB_AVEPERIO = 1,  30, 365,
     ...
     LYR_TEMP     = 0,   4,   0,
     ...

which means that the model layered temperature has a monthly mean output with single precision (4-byte;real4), e.g. ::

   0    - variable is not written
   2    - variable is written as int2 with scale factor and offset
   4    - variable is written as real4
   8    - variable is written as real8


If one would like output of yearly mean layered temperature, simply change LYR_TEMP in user_nl_blom to::

   LYR_TEMP     = 0,   0,   4,

Available output variables for BLOM and iHAMOCC are documented in the resolved namelist file (see CaseDocs/ocn_in after running ./preview_namelists or building the case).


Code modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make more subtantial modification to the BLOM/iHAMOCC code than what is possible by the use of user_nl_blom, there are two methods:

1. Make a branch from the NorESM2 version (branch or release) you want to modify, checkout this branch in order to make code changes directly in the source code folder.

2. Copy the source code (the fortran file(s) you want to modify) to the SourceMods/src.blom folder in the case directory, and then make the modifications needed before building the model. By the use of this method, you will not change the source code in the <noresm-base> folder.

As mentioned above, if you need to change a model parameter for iHAMOCC you need to modify the source code. All iHAMOCC parameters are defined in the routine beleg_parm.F90.

The BLOM source code is located in::
  
  <noresm-base>/components/blom/

The iHAMOCC source code is located in::

  <noresm-base>/components/blom/hamocc
  
Spinup of BLOM-iHAMOCC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The global ocean overturning circulation time-scale is in the order of 1500 years, and usually several cycles of spinup are required, especially for the ocean biogeochemistry to reach a reasonable quasi-equilibrium state. Since running the NorESM model in a fully coupled mode is computationally demanding, it is not practical to run thousands of model years during spinup. To alleviate this issue, the ocean components of NorESM, BLOM and iHAMOCC, can be simulated offline or stand-alone (non fully-coupled), forced by coupler fields for extended period of time until the drift in e.g. interior ocean fields become acceptable. Once this is achieved, the new quasi-equilibrium ocean state is then re-coupled back to the coupled system and integrated forward, usually for a few hundred years to ensure that the shock from re-coupling is minimized.

The following describe the necessary steps to configure and run offline BLOM-iHAMOCC spinup:

1. Generate the coupler forcing fields

    The stand-alone ocean configuration requires boundary condition (atmospheric and land) fields to force the ocean model. In order to allow the ocean model to simulate the interannual-to-decadal variability, we recommend creating 50 years long or longer forcing fields from a fully coupled simulations under preindustrial control setup. The fully coupled simulation should have relatively stable atmospheric states during this 50 years period, with little drift. In order to generate the coupler fields, the following texts need to be included in the ``user_nl_cpl`` file in the case directory: ::

        &seq_infodata_inparm
          histaux_a2x      = .true.  
          histaux_a2x1hr   = .true. 
          histaux_a2x1hri  = .true.
          histaux_a2x3hr   = .true.
          histaux_a2x3hrp = .true.
          histaux_a2x24hr = .true.
          histaux_l2x     = .false.
          histaux_l2x1yrg = .false.
          histaux_r2x     = .true.

2. Post-process the coupler fields

     The coupler fields produced in step 1 are written in daily files and need to be concatenated into monthly files, which the ocean components expect. The script to concatenate and produce the monthly coupler fields is located @fram.sigma2.no: ::

          /cluster/projects/nn2345k/matsbn/NorESM/concat_cpl_hist_mon/concat_cpl_hist_mon.csh


     To generate the monthly fields, execute ::

          concat_cpl_hist_mon.csh CASE_NAME INPUT_DAILY_DIR YEAR1 YEARN OUTPUT_MONTHLY_DIR "ha2x ha2x1hi ha2x1h ha2x3h ha2x1d hr2x"

3. Create the stand-alone ocean case
 
     The compset to run BLOM-iHAMOCC with the monthly coupler forcing is called ``NOICPLHISTOC``, which can be created e.g., as follows ::

          create_newcase --case CASE_DIR_AND_NAME --compset NOICPLHISTOC --res f09_tn14 --machine betzy --project nnXXXXk --run-unsupported

4. Setup the case

     In the case directory, run ::
    
          ./case.setup

5. Modify dependent files

     In the case directory, add the following to ``user_nl_cice`` ::                

         histfreq = 'm','d','x','x','x'
         histfreq_n = 1,1,1,1,1
         f_CMIP = 'mdxxx'
         f_hi ="mxxxx"
         f_hs="mxxxx"
         f_fswdn="mxxxx"
         f_fswabs="mxxxx"
         f_congel="mxxxx"
         f_frazil="mxxxx"
         f_meltt="mxxxx"
         f_melts="mxxxx"
         f_meltb="mxxxx"
         f_meltl="mxxxx"
         f_fswthru="mxxxx"
         f_dvidtt="mxxxx"
         f_dvidtd="mxxxx"
         f_daidtt="mxxxx"
         f_daidtd="mxxxx"
         f_apond_ai="mxxxx"
         f_hpond_ai="mxxxx"
         f_apeff_ai="mxxxx"
         f_snowfrac="mxxxx"
         f_aicen="mxxxx"
         f_snowfracn="mxxxx"
         

     Add the following to ``user_nl_blom`` ::

        set SRXDAY = 6.
        set SRXBAL = .true.  

     Edit or adjust the following entries in ``env_run.xml`` (e.g., for monthly coupler fields from year 751 to 850): ::    

         <entry id="RUN_TYPE" value="hybrid">
         <entry id="RUN_REFCASE" value=‚ÄúCPLHIST_CASE>
         <entry id="RUN_REFDATE" value="0751-01-01">
         <entry id="RUN_STARTDATE" value="0751-01-01">
         <entry id="STOP_OPTION" value="nyears">
         <entry id="STOP_N" value="200">
         <entry id="REST_N" value="25">
         <entry id="DATM_CPLHIST_DIR" value="$DIN_LOC_ROOT/cplhist/CPLHIST_OUTPUT_MONTHLY_DIR">
         <entry id="DATM_CPLHIST_CASE" value=‚ÄúCPLHIST_CASE">
         <entry id="DATM_CPLHIST_YR_ALIGN" value="751">
         <entry id="DATM_CPLHIST_YR_START" value="751">
         <entry id="DATM_CPLHIST_YR_END" value="850">
         <entry id="DROF_CPLHIST_DIR" value="$DIN_LOC_ROOT/cplhist/CPLHIST_OUTPUT_MONTHLY_DIR">
         <entry id="DROF_CPLHIST_CASE" value="CPLHIST_CASE">
         <entry id="DROF_CPLHIST_YR_ALIGN" value="751">
         <entry id="DROF_CPLHIST_YR_START" value="751">
         <entry id="DROF_CPLHIST_YR_END" value="850">

     Edit or adjust the following entries in ``env_mach_pes.xml`` (e.g., for NorESM2-MM configuration): ::

         <entry id="COST_PES" value="480">
         <entry id="MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE" value="32">
         <entry id="MAX_MPITASKS_PER_NODE" value="32">

6. Configure salinity relaxation

    It is recommended that surface salinity is relaxed toward monthly climatology values, e.g., those from earlier coupled runs. This is needed to avoid unexpected drift in the ocean physical states. Monthly climatology files from previous spin-up are available @fram.sigma2.no and @betzy.sigma2.no: ::

         NorESM2-MM: /cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata/ocn/micom/tnx1v4/20170601/sss_climatology_N1850_f09_tn14_20190726_751-850_classic.nc
         NorESM2-LM: /cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata/ocn/micom/tnx1v4/20170601/sss_climatology_N1850OCBDRDDMS_f19_tn14_250119_466_565_classic.nc

    A python script to generate these files is available in: ::

         /cluster/projects/nn2345k/matsbn/NorESM/sss_climatology/sss_climatology.py

    In the case directory, add the following line to ``user_nl_blom`` file: ::

         set SCFILE= '<filename>'

7. Build your case

     In the case directory, run ::

         ./case.build
 
     Adjust the the length of model integration in ``env_run.xlm`` and the respective computing hours in ``env_batch.xml``.

8. Submit the run

     In the case directory, run ::
     
         ./case.submit

9. Prior to 'recoupling' simulation, the dates in atmospheric and land restart files need to be adjusted, e.g., using the following command:

     ncap2 -s 'time=401501' N1850_f19_tn14_21062019_CPLHIST.cam.r.1521-01-01-00000.nc new_adjusted_restart.nc
         
         The 'time' value should be set to the year of the ocean restart files, e.g., the last year of the offline spin-up period.
         
         
CICE
''''
The sea ice model component is based upon version 5.1.2 of the CICE sea ice model of Hunke et al. (2015). 

Initial conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the CICE model is initialized with a 'default', simplified, sea ice field with sea ice in cold regions (air temperature below 0 degree C), north of 70 N and south of 60 S. The sea ice thickness in these regions is horizontal homogeneous, with a uniform snow cover. This behavior is given by the ice_ic variable in the namelist. This can be changed to start without sea ice by setting:
::

  &setup_nml
    ice_ic = "none"


in the user_nl_cice in the case folder, or by specifying a restart file which would give the desired sea ice state:
::

  &setup_nml
    ice_ic = "PATH_TO_FILE/NAME_OF_FILE.cice.r.YEAR-01-01-00000.nc"


The file used for NorESM2-MM CMIP6 piControl simulation is::

  finidat = N1850_f09_tn14_20190913.cice.r.1200-01-01-00000.nc
  
The file used for NorESM2-LM CMIP6 piControl simulation is::

  finidat = N1850_f19_tn14_11062019.cice.r.1600-01-01-00000.nc
  
Information about which file is used as an initial condition (in addition to parameter settings and other files used as input) file is in ice_in. This file can be found in::

  <casefolder>/CaseDocs/ice_in
  
and in the Run folder::

  <RUN_DIR>/case/run/ice_in
  
This information is also written to the ice.log.* file generated during the run.   
  
NorESM2 specific addition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A NorESM2-specific change is including the effect of wind drift of snow into ocean following Lecomte et al. (2013)
This change can be tuned on/off in the user_nl_cice in the case folder. Default is
::

  &snowphys_nml
    blowingsnow = "lecomte2013"
    ksno = 0.3
    rhos = 330.0


and will use NorESM2 treatment of wind drift of snow. Setting
::
 
   &snowphys_nml
     blowingsnow = "none"

will reset the NorESM2 specific addition and the effect of wind drift of snow into ocean will not be included. It is also possible to change the snow density ``rhos`` and the snow thermal conductivity ``ksno``. Be aware that this will influence the overall tuning of the coupled model. 

Modify user name lists for CICE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Output from the model is changed by controlling the user_nl_cice file in your casefolder. By default, the file typically looks like this: 
::

   histfreq = 'm','d','x','x','x'
   histfreq_n = 1,1,1,1,1
   f_CMIP = 'mdxxx'
   f_hi ="mxxxx"
   f_hs="mxxxx"
   f_fswdn="mxxxx"
   f_fswabs="mxxxx"
   f_congel="mxxxx"
   f_frazil="mxxxx"
   f_meltt="mxxxx"
   f_melts="mxxxx"
   f_meltb="mxxxx"
   f_meltl="mxxxx"
   f_fswthru="mxxxx"
   f_dvidtt="mxxxx"
   f_dvidtd="mxxxx"
   f_daidtt="mxxxx"
   f_daidtd="mxxxx"
   f_apond_ai="mxxxx"
   f_hpond_ai="mxxxx"
   f_apeff_ai="mxxxx"
   f_snowfrac="mxxxx"
   f_aicen="mxxxx"
   f_snowfracn="mxxxx"


where the ``f_*`` flags are used to change the writing of specific variables, and the ``histfreq`` and ``histfreq_n`` variables are used to specify type of history files written, and their frequency. The ``f_CMIP`` flag activates the specific SIMIP/CMIP variables used the CMIP6 runs. By default, the model writes extensive output with a monthly frequency, and more limited at daily basis. 

The easiest way to turn of daily output from CICE is to put
::

   histfreq = 'm','x','x','x','x'


in the ``user_nl_cice`` file. 

High-frequency output can be achieved by manipulating the  ``histfreq`` and ``histfreq_n`` variables, together with the specific variable should be at higher frequency. To use 3-hourly output of the sea ice velocity from the model set
::

   histfreq = 'm','d','h','x','x'
   histfreq_n = 1,1,3,1,1
   f_siu = 'm,d,h,x,x'
   f_siv = 'm,d,h,x,x'

Be aware that the model writes one file per time step. Therefore, this should be done for short runs, only, and the high-frequency output should be collected together in one (or a few) larger files after the model run, e.g. by using the ``ncrcat`` command. 

Code modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To make more subtantial modification to the code than what is possible by the use of user_nl_cice, there are two methods:

1. Make a branch from the NorESM2 version (branch or release) you want to modify, checkout this branch in order to make code changes directly in the source code folder.

2. Copy the source code (the fortran file(s) you want to modify) to the SourceMods/src.cice folder in the case directory, and then make the modifications needed before building the model. By the use of this method, you will not change the source code in the <noresm-base> folder.

The CICE source code is located in
::
  
  <noresm-base>/components/cice/src/
