Contribute to NorESM2
=====================

General guidelines for contributing code to NorESM are outlined in the
`CONTRIBUTING.md
<https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ file in the
github repository. This documentation is intended to supplement the general
guidelines with more specific information and step-by-step procedures.

The basic steps for downloading the code has already been described in the
:ref:`download code <download_code>` section of this document. For code
contribution it is generally recommended to use a :ref:`fork-based workflow
<fork_workflow>`, but some non-critical changes (e.g. editing documentation) can
be made with a simplified procedure through GitHub (see `doc/README.md
<https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/blob/master/doc/README.md>`_). It is also
recommended to create a `discussion item
<https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/discussions>`_ or an `issue ticket
<https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/issues>`_ before undertaking any major code
changes. This will alert the NorESM community to what you want to contribute,
provide a forum for feedback from other developers, and reduce the risk of work
duplication and/or conflicts if multiple developers are working on the same part
of the code.
