Answering emails from users
===================================
Procedure for answering questions from external users through the noresm-ncc contact e-mail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Any email to noresm-ncc (UNLESS, see below) will be made into a github issue (in the most relevant repository of NorESMHUB by a noresm-ncc responible, labelled in github “noresm-ncc-question”), and the issue will be assigned to noresm-ncc responsible per repository.
2. UNLESS the answer is straightforward with an email, this is sent with copy to noresm-ncc
3. Acknowledge by email the receipt of the inquiry - explaining further the standard procedure to “user”, including link to github issue, with copy to noresm-ncc
4. Standard procedure: Answering will be done on github
5. Standard procedure: Please check the issue status, and comment further by signing in, sign in if you want to follow the issue
6. Someone from NorESM (assignees) put replies into the github issue, discussion is kept there
7. If discussion is continuing by email, the assignee paste discussion into issue
8. Standard procedure: final reply(ies) will be through closing the issue and sending an email again by the “responsibles” that this issue is closed, with the link to the issue. Remind the user: You may reopen it.
9. What to do with continued discussion? Encourage users to follow the github issue

Dear xxx,

Thank you for your email regarding the NorESM2 data/model.

Please note, that we have included your question in the appropriate NorESMhub github repository (name of repository) as #issue (link to issue). This is done because we thought that the issue could be of interest for other users, and because we are trying to assemble all NorESM2 relevant discussions and documentation under one open platform.

What follows? The issue will be answered as soon as possible by a member of the NorESM2 core team via github. You can follow the (link to issue) on github. You may also get directly notified, when we answer, if you subscribe to the notifications (go to the issue, see for the right panel on github, press notifications button “subscribe”).

Please note that we prefer to keep follow-up discussion on github, and invite you to further comment on the issue on github. You may also remind us of unresolved, urgent issues via github by adding another comment to the issue.

Once we consider the issue resolved, you will also get an email. This is to notify you in case you didn't watch the github issue closely.

| Best wishes
